Overview
==============================

This repository contains relevant code/data for the manuscript "Machine learning based methods to generate conformational ensembles of disordered proteins". 

### Files

* `train_ddpm_w_demb_independent_dim.py` - trains diffusion model
* `sample_ddpm_true_pdist_independent_dim.py` - generates samples from diffusion model given pairwise distances derived from simulation
* `sample_ddpm_sampled_pdist_independent_dim.py` - generates samples from diffusion model given pairwise distances derived from ML model
* `eval_ddpm_sample_functions` - code for placing C-alpha coordinates along a B-spline generated by diffusion model
* The `job_scripts` directory contains the relevant bash scripts used to train and sample the models.
